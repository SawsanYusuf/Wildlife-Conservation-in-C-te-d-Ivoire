In this project, we examined a data science competition that helps scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve. The goal was to take images from camera traps and classify which animal, if any, is present. To complete the competition, we expanded our machine learning skills by creating more powerful neural network models that can take images as inputs and classify them into one of multiple categories.

For a detailed walkthrough of how the model was built and the steps taken, you can read the full article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sawsanyusuf/computer-vision-challenge-1-wild-image-classification-4d040a8ba3d6).
